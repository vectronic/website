Over a long duration I finally constructed the Pocket NC enclosure. And now after an even longer period of time I am posting about it.

Features include:

* (reasonably) soft close/open with gas struts
* high visibility with clear perspex on four sides
* elevated mounting of Pocket NC to allow longer stock in the ER40 collet
* enclosure open signal integration with Pocket NC
* internal iPhone mount for video recording of CNC sessions ðŸ¤“
* integrated LED lighting
* lighting partially switches off when opening to avoid blinding the user ðŸ˜Ž

The build pretty much worked out as planned. There was only one main "gotcha" which was that the
gas struts exert a significant amount of force
on the frame resulting in a large degree of shaking when opening the enclosure. 
For this reason I needed to add some unplanned bracing plates on the rear side uprights.

The rear of the enclosure provides space for mounting:

* a power board
* LED lighting power supply
* a network switch
* a POE lightning cable to power and connect an internally mounted iPhone for recording CNC sessions
* a POE lightning cable to power and connect an externally located iPad for the Penta interface
* the receiver for a [Vers Wireless Touch Probe](https://vers.ge/en/blog/user-guides/wlr-v8) - integration of this is the next step on the journey...

I also worked on a small fitting to allow a dial gauge to be attached. I was planning to measure repeatability, but I'm not sure how useful this will be in practice given it is mounted on a movable part of the machine...

It all looks pretty cool with the iPad beside it for convenient control:
