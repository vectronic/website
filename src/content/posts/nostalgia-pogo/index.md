More than 20 years ago, in the 'dotcom' era, I worked for the web design agency Razorfish and managed to get involved
in a more exciting gig working for a hardware spin-off developing the [Pogo Mobile](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Pogo_Mobile_and_nVoy).

I was responsible for the development of the embedded web browser that acted as the sole UI for the device.

I came across this printout of a screenshot I took when the browser rendering started to take shape.
