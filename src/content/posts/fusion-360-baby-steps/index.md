Life is all about incremental steps forward. And... some steps backwards and sideways as well...

I switched from FreeCAD to Fusion 360 as I want to end up doing some 5 Axis CNC Machining. Currently FreeCAD support
for this is very... far... away...

So here are the results of applying the same learning process of modelling a brick in Fusion 360:

I still have problems with lighting and materials when rendering, but hey, it's good enough. A bad render isn't going
to cause the physical item to fail...

Some nice technical drawings:

Not sure how the difference in templates crept in...

And assembly animation for the win `\(^ãƒ®^)/`
