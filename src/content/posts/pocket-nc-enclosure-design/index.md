Before getting serious with the Pocket NC V2-50CHK, I want to build an enclosure for it. Although there is one
available to buy commercially, I wanted to build a custom one myself that has:

- more vertical clearance underneath the B axis so that I can use longer stock in the ER-40 collet
- excellent access to the machine when open
- excellent visibility of the machine when closed
- built-in LED lighting

I plan to make the enclosure using 80-20 style aluminium profile and fittings from [KJN](https://www.aluminium-profile.co.uk/aluminium-profile-components/br-range-compatible-with-bosch-rexroth-profile).

Gas-struts will keep the lid up when in the open position:

Basic dimensions and a more detailed view at each of the sections:
