A second attempt at the tutorial from Penta was reasonably successful.

{{< figure src="images/beginner-chips.jpg" width="50%">}}

The first attempt was most definitely not: the collet I used didn't tighten up on the workpiece enough
and the workpiece moved towards the mill during the operation. As I looked on in awe at the increasing size of the chips without thinking
to intervene, the mill eventually plunged into the workpiece which then moved and snapped the mill. I have video but won't
publish that... As I said: not successful, beginner chips ðŸ¥¹

This second attempt was reasonably successful excepting a G-code error near the end of the run. I believe it was because
the tool length did not provide enough clearance for parting off, although I am sure I ran the simulation first... 
Hence a third attempt  is in order to double check that everything works as expected and I am doing what is expected of me!

Here is a video showing some of the key action:

At some point I will need to upgrade from the old iPhone in use for filming as I'm not happy with the quality of the video.

Next steps:

* third attempt at the tutorial
* probably a second run at the sample cube piece tutorial now that I am setup in the enclosure with video recording
* integration of the [Vers Wireless Touch Probe](https://vers.ge/en/blog/user-guides/wlr-v8) which seems to have had some [further activity](https://community.pentamachine.com/t/using-josh-pieper-probe-with-fusion-360/453/23).
