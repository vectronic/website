A new feature release version of Legify is available at:

[https://github.com/vectronic/freecad-legify-macros/releases/tag/v0.4.0](https://github.com/vectronic/freecad-legify-macros/releases/tag/v0.4.0)

This provides a new `legify-technic-pin` macro which renders a technic pin onto an existing Part Design workbench body.

Therefore the "s" in the name of the project "freecad-legify-macros" now has real meaning! :stuck_out_tongue_winking_eye:
